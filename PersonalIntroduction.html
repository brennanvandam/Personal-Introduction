		My favorite culture that I am not native to is Japanese. When I was in the military,

		food.

		One of the historical figures that I relate to is Bob Marley. His music is universally enjoyed.
		Another historical figure that I relate to is Medal of Honor recipient John Finn. He did the same
		job I did in the military as a Aviation Ordnanceman. I was stationed on the same base that he was 
		when he earned his medal of honor defending Hawaii against Kamikaze airplanes on Marine Corps Air 
		Station, Kaneohe Bay.
